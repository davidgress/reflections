How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The contents can be different. All files in working directory but they have to be 
manually added to the staging area.
How to write a commit message
You're about to make your first commit to your reflections repository. When you do this, 
you'll need to write a commit message describing your changes. If you followed the
 instructions in the "Setting Up Your Workspace" video for your platform near the 
 end of Lesson 1, the editor you chose will appear as soon as you run git commit 
 and allow you to write a commit message. If you get an error message, you should 
 try revisiting the instructions in Lesson 1 and make sure your text editor is set 
 up properly.

You can also specify a commit message via the command line by running 
git commit -m "Commit message" instead of just git commit. 
It's still a good idea to get an editor set up, since this will make it 
easier to write long commit messages that fully describe the change.

Commit message style
While commit message style varies from person to person, this style guide 
describes some common best practices when writing commit messages.
