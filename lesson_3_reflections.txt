Lesson 4: Using GitHub to collaborate
Reflect 7
When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share it or access it from another computer/location.

Reflect 10 Manual vs automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that you control what is pulled. There may be things you are ready to receive.
Also, you may be in the middle a huge change and a pull might cause conflicts.

Reflect 14 forks, clones, and branches
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
Forks is only on GitHub and is used to put another repository into your account.
Clones is used to copy a repository from GitHub or your own machine.
A branch is a new path from the master of a repository which may be a new feature or 
new version.
When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is used when you want another users files. Branch for new features. Clone to get a whole
copy of a repo or for a backup or release. 

Reflect 22: Local copies of remote branches
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Makes merging easier. Gives a good base to start working on since all changes are known.
